Marine Ecosystems 
What is the primary source of energy for deep sea ecosystems? 
A) Sunlight 
B) Thermal vents 
C) Bioluminescence

Oceanography 
Which layer of the ocean is the most biologically active? 
A) Abyssopelagic Zone 
B) Bathypelagic Zone 
C) Mesopelagic Zone 
D) Epipelagic Zone 
The Epipelagic Zone, also known as the sunlight zone, is the uppermost layer of the ocean and receives enough sunlight to support photosynthesis, making it the most biologically active. 
D) Epipelagic Zone

Coral Reef Ecology 
Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their symbiotic algae. What is the main cause of this phenomenon? 
A) Overfishing 
B) Ocean Acidification 
C) Sea Temperature Rise 
D) Plastic Pollution 
Sea Temperature Rise is the main cause of coral bleaching, as the increased temperatures disrupt the symbiotic relationship between the coral and its algae, leading to the algae's expulsion. 
C) Sea Temperature Rise

Marine Conservation 
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has which of the following marine animals listed in its Appendix I, indicating the highest level of protection? 
A) Blue Whale 
B) Tiger Shark 
C) Great White Shark 
D) Seahorse 
The Seahorse is listed in CITES Appendix I, indicating it is at high risk of extinction and commercial trade of this species is strictly regulated. 
D) Seahorse

Marine Physiology 
What adaptation do deep-sea fishes have to cope with high pressure? 
A) Enhanced vision 
B) Bioluminescence 
C) Reduced skeletal structure 
D) Air-filled swim bladders 
Reduced skeletal structure is an adaptation found in some deep-sea fishes to cope with the high pressure, allowing their bodies to be more flexible and withstand the immense pressure without being crushed. 
C) Reduced skeletal structure

Species Interaction 
In a cleaner fish and host fish relationship, what does the cleaner fish eat? 
A) Algae 
B) Dead skin cells 
C) Parasites 
D) Plankton 
Cleaner fish eat parasites from the surface and gills of the host fish, providing a service by keeping the host healthy and gaining a meal in the process. 
C) Parasites
